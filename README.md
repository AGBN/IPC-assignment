# IPC-assignment
A project I made for the IPC course of 1. semester of PBA Software Development.
It attempts to compare how well the compiler of Visual Studio and Eclipse, actually works, by testing for deadcode elemination and more.
It worked for the assignment, but in the end the result is inconclusive.
